Welcome to our Stock Trading Application! This platform provides users with the ability to buy and sell stocks, manage their portfolios, and view transaction histories seamlessly. Users can authenticate via Google authentication or an OTP-based system for secure access. The application supports both limit and market orders, ensuring flexibility in trading strategies. Built with `Next.js` for the frontend, `Node.js` for the backend, and `MongoDB` for the database, our platform offers a reliable and efficient trading experience.
